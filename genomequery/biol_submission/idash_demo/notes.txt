Suppose we would like to look for deletions on genome NA18506 (the child of 
the African Yoruban trio). Typically, Deletions are indicated by pairs of reads
whose alignment distance is unrealistically long (lenght discordant clones). 
So, one would like to look for regions on the genome of NA18506 which overlap with
at least a number (say 5) of length discordant clones.

Here is how I could specify those requirements in GQL:

>>>>Open q_del.txt and copy line by line to Jbrowse by explaining what is going on.

1. First of all we need to find all length discordant clones.
2. Then we create a special table of intervals from the location and the 
mate_location of the clones above.
3. Afterwards we search for regions that are covered by at least 5 such intervals
4. Since we are interested in the evidence, i.e. the actual reads that support 
our findings, we need to join the regions that we found with the discordant
reads and print the output.

---------------------------------

Suppose now we wish to check whether our findings agree with the deletion
results that are reported by Conrad et.al. Nature Genetics Dec 2005.

Here is a table of deletions that we downloaded from the UCSC browser and
contains results from that paper 

>>>> Open NA18506_known_deletions.txt and show how it looks like.

How would we modify the previous query to compare our findings?

Note that we don't need any more the supporting evidence of reads. So we write
a new query that uses the same methodology as before except for the last merging
with reads

>>> Write a new query by pasting everything before out. Then paste the last 2
>>> lines of q_overlap_known.txt

Now, we take the regions that we found and check whether they overlap with the
findings of Conrad et al (table NA18506_known_deletions)

... wait after the experiment completes. 

Notice that not all areas that Conrad reports appear in our results. Is there
anything wrong with our assumptions??? 

Here is a new experiment that we would like to perform: Upload a table with
those areas of Conrad that do not appear in our results and look for length 
discordant clones that overlap with them.

Let's call this table missing_deletions.

Here is how a query would look like: 

>>>copy the contents of q_evidence_disc.txt

We simply locate discordant clones and intersect them with the missing regions.

...after the query completes.

Note that only 1 region overlaps with discordant clones... What happens to
others? Let's try to collect the concordant clones that overlap with the same
regions

>>>copy the contents of q_evidence_conc.txt run the experiment and make a note
>>>that those areas are covered by concordant clones.

---------------------------

OK now let's try to find what happens with the areas that we report but Conrad
does not. For this experiment we would like to print the concordant reads that
either overlap with the areas that we report or with the neighborhood of those
areas.

Here is the new query:

>>>> copy the contents from q_del.concordant.txt and interpret the output....
