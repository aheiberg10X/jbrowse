Many CNVs were observed in the corresponding regions in both chimpanzees and humans; especially those CNVs of higher frequency. Strikingly, these loci are enriched 20-fold for ancestral segmental duplications, which may facilitate CNV formation through nonallelic homologous recombination mechanisms.

More specifically, models are used to compare empirical measures of sequence variation, linkage disequilibrium (LD), and selection to expectations under a "null" distribution. In the absence of detailed information about human demographic history, and about variation in mutation and recombination rates, simulations have of necessity used arbitrary models, usually simple ones. With the advent of large empirical data sets, it is now possible to calibrate population genetic models with genome-wide data, permitting for the first time the generation of data that are consistent with empirical data across a wide range of characteristics. We present here the first such calibrated model and show that, while still arbitrary, it successfully generates simulated data (for three populations) that closely resemble empirical data in allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, and population differentiation. No assertion is made about the accuracy of the proposed historical and recombination model, but its ability to generate realistic data meets a long-standing need among geneticists. We anticipate that this model, for which software is publicly available, and others like it will have numerous applications in empirical studies of human genetics.},

abstract = {A combination of inter- and intra-species genome comparisons is required to identify and classify the full spectrum of genetic changes, both subtle and gross, that have accompanied the evolutionary divergence of humans and other primates. In this study, gene order comparisons of 11,518 human and chimpanzee orthologous gene pairs were performed to detect regions of inverted gene order that are potentially indicative of small-scale rearrangements such as inversions. By these means, a total of 71 potential micro-rearrangements were detected, nine of which were considered to represent micro-inversions encompassing more than three genes. These putative inversions were then investigated by FISH and/or PCR analyses and the authenticity of five of the nine inversions, ranging in size from \~800 kb to \~4.4 Mb, was confirmed. These inversions mapped to 1p13.2-13.3, 7p22.1, 7p13-14.1, 18p11.21-11.22 and 19q13.12 and encompass 50, 14, 16, 7 and 16 known genes, respectively. Intriguingly, four of the confirmed inversions turned out to be polymorphic: three were polymorphic in the chimpanzee and one in humans. It is concluded that micro-inversions make a significant contribution to genomic variability in both humans and chimpanzees and inversion polymorphisms may be more frequent than previously realized.},

abstract = {The human genome contains numerous blocks of highly homologous duplicated sequence. This higher-order architecture provides a substrate for recombination and recurrent chromosomal rearrangement associated with genomic disease. However, an assessment of the role of segmental duplications in normal variation has not yet been made. On the basis of the duplication architecture of the human genome, we defined a set of 130 potential rearrangement hotspots and constructed a targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray (with 2,194 BACs) to assess copy-number variation in these regions by array comparative genomic hybridization. Using our segmental duplication BAC microarray, we screened a panel of 47 normal individuals, who represented populations from four continents, and we identified 119 regions of copy-number polymorphism (CNP), 73 of which were previously unreported. We observed an equal frequency of duplications and deletions, as well as a 4-fold enrichment of CNPs within hotspot regions, compared with control BACs (P 4-fold within regions of CNP. Almost without exception, CNPs were not confined to a single population, suggesting that these either are recurrent events, having occurred independently in multiple founders, or were present in early human populations. Our study demonstrates that segmental duplications define hotspots of chromosomal rearrangement, likely acting as mediators of normal variation as well as genomic disease, and it suggests that the consideration of genomic architecture can significantly improve the ascertainment of large-scale rearrangements. Our specialized segmental duplication BAC microarray and associated database of structural polymorphisms will provide an important resource for the future characterization of human genomic disorders.},

The low-quality nature of the current chimpanzee genome assembly precludes the reliable identification of many of these differences. To circumvent this, we applied a method to optimally map chimpanzee fosmid paired-end sequences against the human genome to systematically identify sites of structural variation > or = 12 kb between the two species. Our analysis yielded a total of 651 putative sites of chimpanzee deletion (n = 293), insertions (n = 184), and rearrangements consistent with local inversions between the two genomes (n = 174). We validated a subset (19/23) of insertion and deletions using PCR and Southern blot assays, confirming the accuracy of our method. The events are distributed throughout the genome on all chromosomes but are highly correlated with sites of segmental duplication in human and chimpanzee. These structural variants encompass at least 24 Mb of DNA and overlap with > 245 genes. Seventeen of these genes contain exons missing in the chimpanzee genomic sequence and also show a significant reduction in gene expression in chimpanzee. Compared with the pioneering work of Yunis, Prakash, Dutrillaux, and Lejeune, this analysis expands the number of potential rearrangements between chimpanzees and humans 50-fold. Furthermore, this work prioritizes regions for further finishing in the chimpanzee genome and provides a resource for interrogating functional differences between humans and chimpanzees.},

Chromosomal inversions, which are ubiquitous in the genus Drosophila, are known to reduce and redistribute recombination, and thus their specific effect on nucleotide variation may be of major importance as an explanatory factor for levels of DNA variation. Here, we use the coalescent approach to study this effect. First, we develop analytical expressions to predict nucleotide variability in old inversion polymorphisms that have reached mutation-drift-flux equilibrium. The effects on nucleotide variability of a new arrangement appearing in the population and reaching a stable polymorphism are then studied by computer simulation. We show that inversions modulate nucleotide variability in a complex way. The establishment of an inversion polymorphism involves a partial selective sweep that eliminates part of the variability in the population. This is followed by a slow convergence to the equilibrium values. During this convergence, regions close to the breakpoints exhibit much lower variability than central regions. However, at equilibrium, regions close to the breakpoints have higher levels of variability and differentiation between arrangements than regions in the middle of the inverted segment. The implications of these findings for overall variability levels during the evolution of Drosophila species are discussed.}",

Two different mathematical models of recombination were used: the Poisson model (without interference) and the Counting model (with interference). The main results are as follows. (1) Recombination and gene flux are highly site-dependent both inside and outside the inverted regions. (2) Crossing over overwhelms gene conversion as a cause of gene flux in large inversions, while conversion becomes relatively significant in short inversions and in regions around the breakpoints. (3) Under the Counting model the recombination rate between two markers depends strongly on the position of the markers along the inverted segment. Two equally spaced markers in the central part of the inverted segment have less recombination than if they are in a more extreme position. (4) Inversions affect recombination rates in the univerted regions of the chromosome. Recombination increases in the distal segment and decreases in the proximal segment. These results provide an explanation for a number of observations reported in the literature.

Here, we investigate this question using genome-wide polymorphism data. We show that population recombination rates recapitulate a large part of the genetic map information, regardless of the population considered. We also show that the ratio of the population recombination rate estimate of two populations is overall constant along the chromosomes. These two observations support the hypothesis that large-scale recombination patterns are conserved across human populations. Local deviations from the overall pattern of conservation of the recombination rates can be used to select candidate regions with large polymorphic inversions or under local selection.}",

Approximately 100 of these deletions have been experimentally validated using comparative genome hybridization on tiling-resolution oligonucleotide microarrays.

The detected deletions span a total of 267 known and predicted genes. Overall, however, the deleted regions are relatively gene-poor, consistent with the action of purifying selection against deletions. Deletion polymorphisms may well have an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, they are not directly observed in most current gene mapping studies.

RNA scission by Lu(III) ion always occurred at the phosphodiester linkages in front of the two acridines, even when the RNA specimens involved consecutive cytidine sequences of different lengths.

Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the consecutive sequences could be genotyped simultaneously with the indels.}",

title = "{Polymorphic segmental duplications at 8p23.1 challenge the determination of individual defensin gene repertoires and the assembly of a contiguous human reference sequence}",
abstract = "{BACKGROUND: Defensins are important components of innate immunity to combat bacterial and viral infections, and can even elicit antitumor responses. Clusters of defensin (DEF) genes are located in a 2 Mb range of the human chromosome 8p23.1. This DEF locus, however, represents one of the regions in the euchromatic part of the final human genome sequence which contains segmental duplications, and recalcitrant gaps indicating high structural dynamics. RESULTS: We find that inter- and intraindividual genetic variations within this locus prevent a correct automatic assembly of the human reference genome (NCBI Build 34) which currently even contains misassemblies. Manual clone-by-clone alignment and gene annotation as well as repeat and SNP/haplotype analyses result in an alternative alignment significantly improving the DEF locus representation. Our assembly better reflects the experimentally verified variability of DEF gene and DEF cluster copy numbers. It contains an additional DEF cluster which we propose to reside between two already known clusters. Furthermore, manual annotation revealed a novel DEF gene and several pseudogenes expanding the hitherto known DEF repertoire. Analyses of BAC and working draft sequences of the chimpanzee indicates that its DEF region is also complex as in humans and DEF genes and a cluster are multiplied. Comparative analysis of human and chimpanzee DEF genes identified differences affecting the protein structure. Whether this might contribute to differences in disease susceptibility between man and ape remains to be solved. For the determination of individual DEF gene repertoires we provide a molecular approach based on DEF haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Complexity and variability seem to be essential genomic features of the human DEF locus at 8p23.1 and provides an ongoing challenge for the best possible representation in the human reference sequence. Dissection of paralogous sequence variations, duplicon SNPs ans multisite variations as well as haplotypes by sequencing based methods is the way for future studies of interindividual DEF locus variability and its disease association.}",

Genomic DNA sequence differences among individuals are responsible for the inherited components of these complex traits. Reports suggest that intermediate and large-scale DNA copy number and structural variations are prevalent enough to be an important source of genetic variation between individuals. Because association studies to identify genomic loci associated with particular phenotypic traits have focused primarily on genotyping SNPs, it is important to determine whether common structural polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium with common SNPs, and thus can be assessed indirectly in SNP-based studies. Here we examine 100 deletion polymorphisms ranging from 70 bp to 7 kb. We show that common deletions and SNPs ascertained with similar criteria have essentially the same distribution of linkage disequilibrium with surrounding SNPs, indicating that these polymorphisms may share evolutionary history and that most deletion polymorphisms are effectively assayed by proxy in SNP-based association studies.}",

The goal of this study was to investigate chromosomal regions that are inverted between the chimpanzee and human genomes. Using the net alignments for the builds of the human and chimpanzee genome assemblies, we identified a total of 1,576 putative regions of inverted orientation, covering more than 154 mega-bases of DNA. The DNA segments are distributed throughout the genome and range from 23 base pairs to 62 mega-bases in length. For the 66 inversions more than 25 kilobases (kb) in length, 75% were flanked on one or both sides by (often unrelated) segmental duplications. Using PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization we experimentally validated 23 of 27 (85%) semi-randomly chosen regions; the largest novel inversion confirmed was 4.3 mega-bases at human Chromosome 7p14. Gorilla was used as an out-group to assign ancestral status to the variants. All experimentally validated inversion regions were then assayed against a panel of human samples and three of the 23 (13%) regions were found to be polymorphic in the human genome. These polymorphic inversions include 730 kb (at 7p22), 13 kb (at 7q11), and 1 kb (at 16q24) fragments with a 5%, 30%, and 48% minor allele frequency, respectively. Our results suggest that inversions are an important source of variation in primate genome evolution. The finding of at least three novel inversion polymorphisms in humans indicates this type of structural variation may be a more common feature of our genome than previously realized.}",

A test of these models found a strikingly high rate of amino-acid substitution within regions where humans and chimpanzees differ by inversions, suggesting perhaps that our ancestral species underwent a divergence process in which gene flow and inversions played a key role.

abstract = "{The olfactory receptor (OR)-gene superfamily is the largest in the mammalian genome. Several of the human OR genes appear in clusters with > or = 10 members located on almost all human chromosomes, and some chromosomes contain more than one cluster. We demonstrate, by experimental and in silico data, that unequal crossovers between two OR gene clusters in 8p are responsible for the formation of three recurrent chromosome macrorearrangements and a submicroscopic inversion polymorphism. The first two macrorearrangements are the inverted duplication of 8p, inv dup(8p), which is associated with a distinct phenotype, and a supernumerary marker chromosome, +der(8)(8p23.1pter), which is also a recurrent rearrangement and is associated with minor anomalies. We demonstrate that it is the reciprocal of the inv dup(8p). The third macrorearrangment is a recurrent 8p23 interstitial deletion associated with heart defect. Since inv dup(8p)s originate consistently in maternal meiosis, we investigated the maternal chromosomes 8 in eight mothers of subjects with inv dup(8p) and in the mother of one subject with +der(8), by means of probes included between the two 8p-OR gene clusters. All the mothers were heterozygous for an 8p submicroscopic inversion that was delimited by the 8p-OR gene clusters and was present, in heterozygous state, in 26% of a population of European descent. Thus, inversion heterozygosity may cause susceptibility to unequal recombination, leading to the formation of the inv dup(8p) or to its reciprocal product, the +der(8p). After the Yp inversion polymorphism, which is the preferential background for the PRKX/PRKY translocation in XX males and XY females, the OR-8p inversion is the second genomic polymorphism that confers susceptibility to the formation of common chromosome rearrangements. Accordingly, it may be possible to develop a profile of the individual risk of having progeny with chromosome rearrangements.}",

As with many other haploinsufficiency diseases, the mechanism underlying the WBS deletion is thought to be unequal meiotic recombination, probably mediated by the highly homologous DNA that flanks the commonly deleted region. Here, we report the use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify a genomic polymorphism in families with WBS, consisting of an inversion of the WBS region. We have observed that the inversion is hemizygous in 3 of 11 (27%) atypical affected individuals who show a subset of the WBS phenotypic spectrum but do not carry the typical WBS microdeletion. Two of these individuals also have a parent who carries the inversion. In addition, in 4 of 12 (33%) families with a proband carrying the WBS deletion, we observed the inversion exclusively in the parent transmitting the disease-related chromosome. These results suggest the presence of a newly identified genomic variant within the population that may be associated with the disease. It may result in predisposition to primarily WBS-causing microdeletions, but may also cause translocations and inversions.}",

Taking into consideration the fact that this translocation may be undetected in routine cytogenetics, we find that it may be the most frequent translocation after t(11q;22q), which is the most common reciprocal translocation in humans. Case subjects with der(4) have the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, whereas case subjects with der(8) show a milder spectrum of dysmorphic features. Two pairs of the many olfactory receptor (OR)-gene clusters are located close to each other, on both 4p16 and 8p23. Previously, we demonstrated that an inversion polymorphism of the OR region at 8p23 plays a crucial role in the generation of chromosomal imbalances through unusual meiotic exchanges. These findings prompted us to investigate whether OR-related inversion polymorphisms at 4p16 and 8p23 might also be involved in the origin of the t(4;8)(p16;p23) translocation. In seven case subjects (five of whom both represented de novo cases and were of maternal origin), including individuals with unbalanced and balanced translocations, we demonstrated that the breakpoints fell within the 4p and 8p OR-gene clusters. FISH experiments with appropriate bacterial-artificial-chromosome probes detected heterozygous submicroscopic inversions of both 4p and 8p regions in all the five mothers of the de novo case subjects. Heterozygous inversions on 4p16 and 8p23 were detected in 12.5% and 26% of control subjects, respectively, whereas 2.5% of them were scored as doubly heterozygous.

abstract = "{We analyzed five patients with inverted duplication deletion of 8p [inv dup del(8p)] using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) analysis. In all patients, inv dup del(8p) consisted of a deleted distal segment, an intact in-between segment, and a duplicated proximal segment. In all of them, the proximal breakpoint of the deletion and one of the breakpoints of the duplication were identical, each located at one of the two olfactory receptor gene clusters at 8p23. FISH analysis showed all their mothers to be heterozygous carriers of an 8p23 inversion [inv(8)(p23)]. STRP analysis indicated that the deletions occurred in maternally derived chromosomes. The duplicated segments had two copies of maternal, either heterozygous or homozygous alleles. These findings support and reinforce those in 16 patients with inv dup del(8p) and their parents by Floridia et al. [1996: Am J Hum Genet 58:785-796] and subsequent additional studies of 10 of them by Giglio et al. [2001: Am J Hum Genet 68:874-883]. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the inv dup del(8p) formation. The inverted segment and its normal counterpart in inv(8)(p23) heterozygous carrier mothers form a loop at the pachytene period of meiosis I. Inv dup del(8p) with heterozygous duplication is formed through at least one meiotic recombination within the loop. Inv dup del(8p) with the homozygous duplication arises through two meiotic recombinations on the inv(8)(p23) chromosome (one within the loop and the other between the loop and centromere). Subsequent rescue by eliminating a part of the duplicated segment and a centromere enables formation of viable inv dup del(8p). The frequency of the inv(8)(p23) allele is 39% in a normal Japanese population, comparable to 26% in Europeans Giglio et al. [2001: Am J Hum Genet 68:874-883]. The proposed mechanism of formation of inv dup del(8p) requires two independent events (a recombination within the loop and subsequent rescue), which may explain its rarity.}",

abstract = "{The term 'genomic disorder' refers to a disease that is caused by an alteration of the genome that results in complete loss, gain or disruption of the structural integrity of a dosage sensitive gene(s). In most of the common chromosome deletion/duplication syndromes, the rearranged genomic segments are flanked by large (usually >10 kb), highly homologous low copy repeat (LCR) structures that can act as recombination substrates. Recombination between non-allelic LCR copies, also known as non-allelic homologous recombination, can result in deletion or duplication of the intervening segment. Recent findings suggest that other chromosomal rearrangements, including reciprocal, Robertsonian and jumping translocations, inversions, isochromosomes and small marker chromosomes, may also involve susceptibility to rearrangement related to genome structure or architecture. In several cases, LCRs, AT-rich palindromes and pericentromeric repeats are located at such rearrangement breakpoints. Analysis of the products of recombination at the junctions of the rearrangements reveals both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining as causative mechanisms. Thus, a more global concept of genomic disorders emerges in which susceptibility to rearrangements occurs due to underlying complex genomic architecture. Interestingly, this architecture plays a role not only in disease etiology, but also in primate genome evolution. In this review, we discuss recent advances regarding general mechanisms for the various rearrangements of our genome, and potential models for rearrangements with non-homologous breakpoint regions.}",

The International Haplotype Map (HapMap) project to construct a comprehensive catalog of haplotypic variation in humans is underway. However, a number of factors have already been shown to influence the definition of blocks, including the population studied and the sample SNP density. Here, we examine the effect that marker selection has on the definition of blocks and the pattern of haplotypes by using comparable but complementary SNP sets and a number of block definition methods in various genomic regions and populations that were provided by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. We find that the chosen SNP set has a profound effect on the block-covered sequence and block borders, even at high marker densities. Our results question the very concept of discrete haplotype blocks and the possibility of generalizing block findings from the HapMap project. We comparatively apply the block-free tagging-SNP approach and discuss both the haplotype approach and the tagging-SNP approach as means to efficiently catalog genetic variation.}",

The H2 lineage is rare in Africans, almost absent in East Asians but found at a frequency of 20% in Europeans, in whom the haplotype structure is indicative of a history of positive selection.

abstract = "{Human genetic linkage maps are based on rates of recombination across the genome. These rates in humans vary by the sex of the parent from whom alleles are inherited, by chromosomal position, and by genomic features, such as GC content and repeat density. We have examined--for the first time, to our knowledge--racial/ethnic differences in genetic maps of humans. We constructed genetic maps based on 353 microsatellite markers in four racial/ethnic groups: whites, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and East Asians (Chinese and Japanese). These maps were generated using 9,291 subjects from 2,900 nuclear families who participated in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded Family Blood Pressure Program, the largest sample used for map construction to date. Although the maps for the different groups are generally similar, we did find regional and genomewide differences across ethnic groups, including a longer genomewide map for African Americans than for other populations. Some of this variation was explained by genotyping artifacts--namely, null alleles (i.e., alleles with null phenotypes) at a number of loci--and by ethnic differences in null-allele frequencies. In particular, null alleles appear to be the likely explanation for the excess map length in African Americans. We also found that nonrandom missing data biases map results. However, we found regions on chromosome 8p and telomeric segments with significant ethnic differences and a suggestive interval on chromosome 12q that were not due to genotype artifacts. The difference on chromosome 8p is likely due to a polymorphic inversion in the region. The results of our investigation have implications for inferences of possible genetic influences on human recombination as well as for future linkage studies, especially those involving populations of nonwhite ethnicity.}",

title = "{Chromosome inversions, local adaptation, and speciation}",
abstract = "{We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally-adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally-favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.}",

The WBSinv-1 chromosome has been shown to occur frequently in parents of individuals with WBS, implying that it predisposes the region to the WBS deletion. Here we investigate two WBS families with multiple affected children, and show that in one family, both siblings have a deletion on a WBSinv-1 chromosome background that arose due to interchromosomal recombination. These results suggest that the two WBS deletions in this family were independent events, and that there is likely a significant increase in the risk of deletion of the WBS region associated with the WBSinv-1 chromosome. The rarity of multiplex WBS families would suggest that the overall risk of having a child with WBS is still relatively low; however, families with an existing member with WBS may choose to opt for WBSinv-1 testing and genetic counseling.}",

abstract = "{Familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions at autopsy, is linked to a chromosomal region at 17q21 (FTDU-17), encompassing the gene encoding the microtubule associated protein tau, MAPT. Mutations in MAPT were previously identified in familial FTD with parkinsonism (FTDP-17); however, in FTDU-17 patients, no pathogenic mutations were found in exonic regions consistent with the lack of tauopathy in FTDU-17 brains. Here, we excluded mutations in MAPT by genomic sequencing of 138.5 kb in FTDU-17 patients. Next, to facilitate the identification of the actual underlying genetic defect, we assembled the 6.5 Mb FTDU-17 sequence. Annotation demonstrated that MAPT is surrounded by three highly homologous low-copy repeats (LCRs) in a region of 1.7 Mb. Using evolutionary studies, short tandem repeat-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) and macro-restriction mapping, we demonstrated that these LCRs are at the basis of a series of rearrangements in the MAPT genomic region. One is an inversion that occurred 3 million years ago and resulted in a common polymorphism in humans to date. This inversion plus flanking LCRs spanned approximately 1.3 Mb and was shown to underlie the extended LD and haplotypes H1 and H2 across MAPT. However, in the FTDU-17 families, we ascertained segregation analysis precluding a relationship between the FTDU-17 and the H1/H2 inversion. The presence of multiple homologous LCRs in the region predicts that other potentially more complex genomic rearrangements might be underlying FTDU-17.}",

                 alternative to the classical {DNA} sequencing approaches.
                 However, the resolving power of {SBH} is rather low: with
                 64 Kb sequencing chips unknown {DNA} fragments only as
                 long as 200 bp can be reconstructed in a single {SBH}
                 experiment. To improve the resolving power of {SBH}
                 Broude {\em et. al.}, 1994\nocite{Broude94} recently
                 suggested {\em positional {SBH}} (PSBH) allowing (with
                 additional experimental work) to measure approximate
                 positions of every \$1\$-tuple in a target {DNA}
                 fragment. We study the {\em positional eulerian path}
                 problem motivated by PSBH. The input to the positional
                 eulerian path problem is an eulerian graph \$G(V,E)\$
                 in which every edge has an associated range of integers
                 and the problem is to find an eulerian path \$e_1,
                 \1dots, e_{|E|}\$ in \$G\$ such that the range of
                 \$e_i\$ contains \$i\$. We show that positional
                 eulerian path problem is NP-complete even when the
                 maximum out-degree (in-degree) of any vertex in the
                 graph is 2. On the positive note we present polynomial
                 algorithms to solve a special case of PSBH (bounded
                 PSBH), where the range of the allowed positions for any
                 edge is bounded by a constant (it corresponds to
                 accurate experimental measurements of positions in
                 PSBH). Moreover, if the positions of every \$1\$-tuple
                 in an unknown {DNA} fragment of length \$n\$ are measured
                 with \$0(\log n)\$ error, then our algorithm runs in
                 polynomial time. We also present an estimate of the
                 resolving power of PSBH for more realistic case when
                 positions are measured with \$\Theta(n)\$ error.",

	These are termed genomic disorders, in which the clinical phenotype
	is a consequence of abnormal dosage of gene(s) located within the
	rearranged genomic fragments. Both inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements
	are facilitated by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats
	(LCRs) and result from nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR)
	between paralogous genomic segments. LCRs usually span approximately
	10-400 kb of genomic DNA, share >or= 97% sequence identity, and provide
	the substrates for homologous recombination, thus predisposing the
	region to rearrangements. Moreover, it has been suggested that higher
	order genomic architecture involving LCRs plays a significant role
	in karyotypic evolution accompanying primate speciation.},

                 \$O(4\^{}k)\$, still for a cost \$O(4\^{}k)\$. This
                 work describes a simulation of the method developed to

                 duplication/speciation/loss events along the
                 evolutionary tree is introduced. The model is employed
                 for embedding a plylogeny tree into another one via so
                 called Duplication/Speciation principle requiring that
                 the gene duplicated evolves in such a way that any of
                 the contemporary species involved bears only one of the
                 gene copies diverged. The number of biologically
                 meaningful elements in the embedding result
                 (duplications, losses, information gaps) is considered
                 a (asymmetric) dissimilarity measure between the trees.
                 The model duplication concept is compared with that one
                 defined previously in terms of a mapping procedure for
                 the trees. A graph-theoretic reformulation of the
                 measure is derived.",

In this method nucleotide databases are translated in six reading frames, and the resulting amino acid sequences are searched &quot;on the fly&quot; to identify and fit linear sequences to the fragmentation patterns observed in the tandem mass spectra of peptides. A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted by amino acid sequences translated from the nucleotide database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions for the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Measurements of the deviation from maximum similarity employing the spectral reconstruction method are made. The search method employing nucleotide databases is also demonstrated on the spectra of phosphorylated peptides. Specific sites of modification are identified even though no specific information relevant to sites of modification is contained in the character-based sequence information of nucleotide databases.}",

abstract = "{A method to correlate uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of modified peptides, produced under low-energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions, with amino acid sequences in a protein database has been developed. The fragmentation patterns observed in the tandem mass spectra of peptides containing covalent modifications is used to directly search and fit linear amino acid sequences in the database. Specific information relevant to sites of modification is not contained in the character-based sequence information of the databases. The search method considers each putative modification site as both modified and unmodified in one pass through the database and simultaneously considers up to three different sites of modification. The search method will identify the correct sequence if the tandem mass spectrum did not represent a modified peptide. This approach is demonstrated with peptides containing modifications such as S-carboxymethylated cysteine, oxidized methionine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine. In addition, a scanning approach is used in which neutral loss scans are used to initiate the acquisition of product ion MS/MS spectra of doubly charged phosphorylated peptides during a single chromatographic run for data analysis with the database-searching algorithm. The approach described in this paper provides a convenient method to match the nascent tandem mass spectra of modified peptides to sequences in a protein database and thereby identify previously unknown sites of modification.}",

title = "{Statistical characterization of ion trap tandem mass spectra from doubly charged tryptic peptides}",
abstract = "{Collision-induced dissociation (CID) is a common ion activation technique used to energize mass-selected peptide ions during tandem mass spectrometry. Characteristic fragment ions form from the cleavage of amide bonds within a peptide undergoing CID, allowing the inference of its amino acid sequence. The statistical characterization of these fragment ions is essential for improving peptide identification algorithms and for understanding the complex reactions taking place during CID. An examination of 1465 ion trap spectra from doubly charged tryptic peptides reveals several trends important to understanding this fragmentation process. While less abundant than y ions, b ions are present in sufficient numbers to aid sequencing algorithms. Fragment ions exhibit a characteristic series-specific relationship between their masses and intensities. Each residue influences fragmentation at adjacent amide bonds, with Pro quantifiably enhancing cleavage at its N-terminal amide bond and His increasing the formation of b ions at its C-terminal amide bond. Fragment ions corresponding to a formal loss of ammonia appear preferentially in peptides containing Gln and Asn. These trends are partially responsible for the complexity of peptide tandem mass spectra.}",

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.}",

The new mode has been coded as an extension to the Mascot search engine, and tested against a number of Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry datasets. The results show a number of additional peptide matches, but require careful interpretation. The most significant limitation of this approach is that it can only reveal new matches to proteins that already have at least one significant peptide match.}",

A key requirement for its success is the ability to identify proteins in complex mixtures. Recent technological advances in tandem mass spectrometry has made it the method of choice for high-throughput identification of proteins. Unfortunately, the software for unambiguously identifying peptide sequences has not kept pace with the recent hardware improvements in mass spectrometry instruments. Critical for reliable high-throughput protein identification, scoring functions evaluate the quality of a match between experimental spectra and a database peptide. Current scoring function technology relies heavily on ad-hoc parameterization and manual curation by experienced mass spectrometrists. In this work, we propose a two-stage stochastic model for the observed MS/MS spectrum, given a peptide. Our model explicitly incorporates fragment ion probabilities, noisy spectra, and instrument measurement error. We describe how to compute this probability based score efficiently, using a dynamic programming technique. A prototype implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.}",

	Gene dosage methods provide the additional benefit of reporting

  abstract = {The messenger RNA (mRNA) from 5 of 69 patients with severe hemophilia
	A did not support amplification of complementary DNA containing
	the first few exons of the factor VIII (F8) gene but supported amplification
	of mRNA containing exon 1 of F8 plus exons of the VBP1 gene. This
	chimeric mRNA signals an inversion breaking intron 1 of the F8 gene.
	Using an inversion patient, one deleted for F8 exons 1 to 6, and
	cosmids mapped 70 to 100 kb telomeric of the F8 gene, this study
	shows that this break strictly affects a sequence (int1h-1) repeated
	(int1h-2) about 140 kb more telomerically, between the C6.1A and
	VBP1 genes. The 1041-base pair repeats differ at a single nucleotide
	(although int1h-2 also showed one polymorphism) and are in opposite
	orientation. The results demonstrate that they cause inversions
	by intrachromosome or intrachromatid homologous recombination. The
	genomic structure of the inversion region shows that transcription
	traverses intergenic spaces to produce the 2 chimeric mRNAs containing
	the F8 sequences and characteristic of the inversion. This observation
	prompts the suggestion that nature may use such extended transcription
	to test whether the addition of novel domains from neighboring genes
	creates desirable new genes. A rapid polymerase chain reaction test
	was developed for the inversion in both patients and carriers. This
	has identified 10 inversions, affecting F8 genes with 5 different
	haplotypes for the BclI, introns 13 and 22 VNTR polymorphism, among
	209 unrelated families with severe hemophilia A. This indicates
	a prevalence of 4.8% and frequent recurrence of the inversion. This
	should result in absence of F8, and one inversion patient is known
	to have inhibitors. (Blood. 2002;99:168-174)},

  abstract = {In breast cancer, several chromosomal sites frequently undergo amplification,
	implicating the location of genes important for tumor development
	and progression. Here we cloned two novel genes, breast carcinoma
	amplified sequence 3 (BCAS3) and 4 (BCAS4), from the two most common
	amplification sites in breast cancer, 17q23 and 20q13. The BCAS3
	gene at 17q23 spans more than 600 kb at the genomic level and was
	predicted to encode a 913 amino acid nuclear protein. The BCAS4
	gene at 20q13.2 encodes a 211 amino acid cytoplasmic protein. Both
	BCAS3 and BCAS4 represent novel genes with no homologies to any
	other known gene or protein. In the MCF7 breast cancer cell line,
	the BCAS3 and BCAS4 genes were co-amplified, and cloning of a highly
	overexpressed 1.3-kb transcript revealed a rearrangement fusing
	the last two exons of BCAS3 with BCAS4. The fusion led to a novel
	message in which only the first exon of BCAS4 and part of exon 23
	of BCAS3 were transcribed. The BCAS4-BCAS3 fusion transcript was
	detected only in MCF7 cells, but the BCAS4 gene was also overexpressed
	in nine of 13 breast cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our results
	indicate that these novel genes, BCAS3 at 17q23 and BCAS4 at 20q13.2,
	undergo amplification, overexpression, and fusion in breast cancer
	and therefore may have a role in the frequent chromosomal alterations
	affecting these two loci.},

	of a CAD cosmid to demonstrate that gene position profoundly affects

	CAD genes at a frequency at least 100-fold higher than did the other

	comprises most of the CAD episome, does not replicate autonomously
	when transfected into cells, our results indicate that either the
	process which generated the episome resulted in a cellular origin
	of DNA replication being linked to the CAD sequences or specific

  abstract = {The CDKN2A gene maps to chromosome 9p21-22 and is responsible for
	melanoma susceptibility in some families. Its product, p16, binds
	specifically to CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting their
	kinase activity. CDKN2A is homozygously deleted or mutated in a
	large proportion of tumor cell lines and some primary tumors, including
	melanomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement
	of CDKN2A and elucidate the mechanisms of p16 inactivation in a
	panel of 60 cell lines derived from sporadic melanomas. Twenty-six
	(43\%) of the melanoma lines were homozygously deleted for CDKN2A,
	and an additional 15 (25\%) lines carried missense, nonsense, or
	frameshift mutations. All but one of the latter group were shown
	by microsatellite analysis to be hemizygous for the region of 9p
	surrounding CDKN2A. p16 was detected by Western blotting in only
	five of the cell lines carrying mutations. Immunoprecipitation of
	p16 in these lines, followed by Western blotting to detect the coprecipitation
	of CDK4 and CDK6, revealed that p16 was functionally compromised
	in all cell lines but the one that carried a heterozygous CDKN2A
	mutation. In the remaining 19 lines that carried wild-type CDKN2A
	alleles, Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation indicated
	that 11 cell lines expressed a wild-type protein. Northern blotting
	was performed on the remaining eight cell lines and revealed that
	one cell line carried an aberrantly sized RNA transcript, and two
	other cell lines failed to express RNA. The promoter was found to
	be methylated in five cell lines that expressed CDKN2A transcript
	but not p16. Presumably, the message seen by Northern blotting in
	these cell lines is the result of cross-hybridization of the total
	cDNA probe with the exon 1beta transcript. Microsatellite analysis
	revealed that the majority of these cell lines were hemi/homozygous
	for the region surrounding CDKN2A, indicating that the wild-type
	allele had been lost. In the 11 cell lines that expressed functional
	p16, microsatellite analysis revealed loss of heterozygosity at
	the markers immediately surrounding CDKN2A in five cases, and the
	previously characterized R24C mutation of CDK4 was identified in
	one of the remaining 6 lines. These data indicate that 55 of 60
	(92\%) melanoma cell lines demonstrated some aberration of CDKN2A
	or CDK4, thus suggesting that this pathway is a primary genetic
	target in melanoma development.},

	It is therefore of interest to develop models which predict the

	infers the topology of the tree, under plausible assumptions. In
	this paper, we extend that work in the direction of the so-called
	distance-based trees, in which events are leaves of the tree, in
	the style of models common in phylogenetics. Then we show how to
	reconstruct the distance-based trees using tree-fitting algorithms
	developed by researchers in phylogenetics. The main advantages of
	the distance-based models are that 1) they represent information
	about co-occurrences of all pairs of events, instead of just some
	pairs, 2) they allow quantitative predictions about which events
	occur early in tumor progression, and 3) they bring into play the
	extensive methodology and software developed in the context of phylogenetics.
	We illustrate the distance-based tree method and how it complements
	the branching tree method, with a CGH data set for renal cancer.},

	are ubiquitous in the genus Drosophila, are known to reduce and

	levels of DNA variation. Here, we use the coalescent approach to
	study this effect. First, we develop analytical expressions to predict
	nucleotide variability in old inversion polymorphisms that have
	reached mutation-drift-flux equilibrium. The effects on nucleotide
	variability of a new arrangement appearing in the population and

	We show that inversions modulate nucleotide variability in a complex

	selective sweep that eliminates part of the variability in the population.
	This is followed by a slow convergence to the equilibrium values.
	During this convergence, regions close to the breakpoints exhibit
	much lower variability than central regions. However, at equilibrium,
	regions close to the breakpoints have higher levels of variability
	and differentiation between arrangements than regions in the middle

	Although the "overlap - layout - consensus" approach proved to be

	population are cohybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes, using
	blocking DNA to suppress signals from repetitive sequences. The
	resulting ratio of the fluorescence intensities at a location on
	the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the chromosomes, is approximately
	proportional to the ratio of the copy numbers of the corresponding
	DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes. CGH has been broadly
	applied to human and mouse malignancies. The use of metaphase chromosomes,
	however, limits detection of events involving small regions (of
	less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution of closely spaced aberrations
	and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic markers. Therefore,
	more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have been required for
	higher resolution studies. Hybridization to an array of mapped sequences
	instead of metaphase chromosomes could overcome the limitations
	of conventional CGH (ref. 6) if adequate performance could be achieved.
	Copy number would be related to the test/reference fluorescence
	ratio on the array targets, and genomic resolution could be determined
	by the map distance between the targets, or by the length of the
	cloned DNA segments. We describe here our implementation of array
	CGH. We demonstrate its ability to measure copy number with high
	precision in the human genome, and to analyse clinical specimens
	by obtaining new information on chromosome 20 aberrations in breast
	cancer.},

	in tumor cells. While many duplications associated with tumors have
	been identified (e.g. via techniques such as CGH), both the organization
	of the duplicated sequences and the process that leads to these
	duplications are less clear. One mechanism that has been observed
	to lead to duplication is the extraction of DNA from the chromosomes
	and aggregation of this DNA into small, independently replicating
	linear or circular DNA sequences (amplisomes). Parts of these amplisomes
	may later be reinserted back into the main chromosomes leading to
	duplication. Although amplisomes are known to play an important
	role in tumorigenesis, their architecture and even size remain largely
	unknown. RESULTS: We reconstruct the structure of tumor amplisomes
	by analyzing duplications in the tumor genome. Our approach relies
	on recently generated data from End Sequence Profiling (ESP) experiments,
	which allow us to examine the fine structure of duplications in
	a tumor on a genome-wide scale. Using ESP data, we formulate the
	Amplisome Reconstruction Problem, describe an algorithm for its

  abstract = {Spontaneous telomere loss has been proposed as an important mechanism
	for initiating the chromosome instability commonly found in cancer
	cells. We have previously shown that spontaneous telomere loss in
	a human cancer cell line initiates breakage/fusion/bridge (B/F/B)
	cycles that continue for many cell generations, resulting in DNA
	amplification and translocations on the chromosome that lost its
	telomere. We have now extended these studies to determine the effect
	of the loss of a single telomere on the stability of other chromosomes.
	Our study showed that telomere acquisition during B/F/B cycles occurred
	mainly through translocations involving either the nonreciprocal
	transfer or duplication of the arms of other chromosomes. Telomere
	acquisition also occurred through small duplications involving the
	subtelomeric region of the other end of the same chromosome. Although
	all of these mechanisms stabilized the chromosome that lost its
	telomere, they differed in their consequences for the stability
	of the genome as a whole. Telomere acquisition involving nonreciprocal
	translocations resulted in the loss of a telomere on the donor chromosome,
	which consequently underwent additional translocations, isochromosome
	formation, or complete loss. In contrast, telomere acquisition involving
	duplications stabilized the genome, although the large duplications
	created substantial allelic imbalances. Thus, the loss of a single
	telomere can generate a variety of chromosome alterations commonly
	associated with human cancer, not only on a chromosome that loses
	its telomere but also on other chromosomes. Factors promoting telomere
	loss are therefore likely to have an important role in generating
	the karyotype evolution associated with human cancer.},

There is a pressing need for methods for finding overlapping sequence intervals that are highly scalable to database size, query interval size, result size and construction/updating of the interval database.Results:âWe have developed a new interval database representation, the Nested Containment List (NCList), whose query time is O(n + log N), where N is the database size and n is the size of the result set. In all cases tested, this query algorithm is 5â500-fold faster than other indexing methods tested in this study, such as MySQL multi-column indexing, MySQL binning and R-Tree indexing. We provide performance comparisons both in simulated datasets and real-world genome alignment databases, across a wide range of database sizes and query interval widths. We also present an in-place NCList construction algorithm that yields database construction times that are â¼100-fold faster than other methods available. The NCList data structure appears to provide a useful foundation for highly scalable interval database applications.Availability:âNCList data structure is part of Pygr, a bioinformatics graph database library, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygrContact: leec@chem.ucla.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
