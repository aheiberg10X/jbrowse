hello

to make go:

change the path of samtools in the various make files

go to indexing/ dir, feed: locate_mates <bamfile> > bamfile.mates
then: index_mates bamfile.mates <bamfile> output
output goes to .sh

create the dst/ dir in biosql/ so the output has somewhere to go

add #!/bin/bash to run_biosql.sh
also added parameters so the BAM file in code_generator.py doesn't have to be hardcoded

in run_biosql.sh, must: 'cd ../genomequery/biosql_compiler/biosql

parameterize the BAM and bam.indx files supplied to run_biosql.sh and code_gen.py
